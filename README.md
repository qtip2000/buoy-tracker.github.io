# NOAA Buoy Data Viewer

This project uses **NOAA's Buoy API** to fetch live ocean data, such as wave height, wave period, wind speed, and more. It then processes the data and converts units into user-friendly formats. The refined data is accessible via a simple web interface.

## Features
- **Live Ocean Data**: Fetches real-time readings from NOAA's Buoy API.
- **Unit Conversion**: Automatically converts units (e.g., meters to feet, Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-read dashboard for viewing buoy data.
- **Lightweight Backend**: Built using Python and Flask.

## How It Works
1. **Data Fetching**: The Python backend queries NOAA's Buoy API for live readings.
2. **Data Refinement**: The raw data is processed and converted to user-friendly units.
3. **Web Interface**: The data is displayed on a simple website hosted on GitHub Pages.
